# Introduction 
The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) software 
was initially developed to integrate static protein-DNA interaction data with time series gene expression data 
for reconstructing dynamic regulatory networks. 
In recent years, several additional types of high-throughput time series data have been used to study biological 
processes including time series miRNA expression, proteomics, epigenomics and single cell RNA-Seq. 
Integrating all available time series and static datasets in a unified model remains an important challenge and goal.
To address this goal, and to enable interactive queries of the resulting learned models 
we have developed a new version of DREM termed interactive DREM (iDREM). 
iDREM provides support for all data types mentioned above and more. 
Importantly, it also allows users to interactively visualize a gene, TF, path or model-centric view of each of these data types, 
their interactions and their impact on the resulting model. 
We showcase the functionality of the new tool by applying it to integrate several data types from multiple labs for 
modeling brain development regulatory networks. The following figures presents the flowchart.  

![flowchart](./images/flowchart.png)
# PREREQUISITES
* Java  
To use iDREM, a version of Java 1.7 or later must be installed.  If Java 1.7 or later is not
currently installed, please refer to [http://www.java.com](http://www.java.com) for installation instructions. 

* JavaScript
To enable the interactive visualization powered by Javascript, please make sure that you have Internet connection. 

# INSTALLATION

To download iDREM, simply download and extract iDREM package.
Use the iDREM jar package inside the unzipped directory.  
If users want to use the jar package outside the directory, please
add the iDREM diretory to $PATH. 
Please refer [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml) for instructions to set up system environment variable. 

# USAGE
To execute iDREM from a command line, change to the iDREM directory and then type:

```shell
java -Xmx4g -jar idrem.jar
```

iDREM can be run in batch mode to learn models without going through the graphical interface. 
Batch mode is useful for learning multiple iDREM model in parallel or interacting iDREM with external scripts.
In batch mode, the DREM settings are read from the file "settingsfile.txt", which has the same format as the "default_config" file, and
the model file "outmodelfile.txt" is automatically saved after the learning precedure terminates. The saved model file can then be
loaded into iDREM for later viewing. To run iDREM in batch model, use the command:

```shell
java -Xmx4G -jar idrem.jar -b settingsfile.txt outmodelfile.xt

```

iDREM input interface(required, users need to specify to run iDREM)  
![iDREMain](./images/inputdrem.png)
* __1. Data Input__  
	* __TF-gene Interaction source:__  
	Users can choose from default TF-gene interactions database we collected.  
	
	* __TF-gene Interaction File:__  
	Users need to provide the customized TF-gene interaction File if choose User Provided TF-gene Interaction source.
	It must follow the following formatting requirements:  
	
	1st row: header, it should be "TF	Gene	Input" (tab-delimited).  
	remaining rows: 1st col  is TF, 2nd col is Gene, 3nd col is interaction between TF-Gene (1/0 binary or a score)  
	
	example input:  
	```
	TF	Gene	Input
	CD40	ANPEP	1
	NKX2-1	ALS2CL	1
	NFKB1	ALS2CL	1
	
	```
	* __Expression Data File:__  
	This species the mRNA expression file.  Please choose right normalization method.   
	If the expression is already in log-space, please choose "normalize data".    
	If the expression is not in log-space, please choose "log normalize data".   
	Both "normalize data" and "log normalized data" are using the expression at the first time point as the anchor to 
	study the expression changes through the time. This is recommended. However, if you prefer to use 0 expression as the anchor 
	to study the expression changes, please choose "No normalization/add 0". Please note this requires that the expression must
	be in log space. 
	
	The expression data must follow the formatting requirments:  
	header row (1st row): 1st column- Gene , remaining columns- time point IDs.   
	data rows (2nd -last row): 1st column-Gene Symbol, remaining columns- expression values at each time point.  
	
	Example input: 
	
	![expression data](./images/datafiledrem.png)
	
	If users have repeats for expression data, there are two ways to use them:  
	__First__, users pre-process the repeats. For each gene, take the median expression over all repeats. This requires that all repeats cover 
	the same time points.  Then use the processed expression as the input expression data.
	 
	__Second__, let iDREM process the repeats data, simply upload the repeats using "Repeat Data" button.  
	The repeats file should be in the same format as the expression data. By default, the repeat data 
	should cover the same time points as the original expression data ('The same time period' checkbox).
	However, if the repeat time covers different period, some information from the repeats can still be used. Please 
	refer the "manual" for details. 

*  __2. Gene Annotation Input__  
	* __Gene Annotation Source__  
	iDREM provides Gene Ontology (GO) annotation files for most well-studied organisms. 
	For complete list of provided GO annotation files, please refer to the iDREM manual. 
	
	* __Gene Annotation File__  
	This file contains the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of genes.  The file can be in one of two formats:

	The file can be in the official 15 column GO Annotation format described at http://www.geneontology.org/GO.annotation.shtml#file.
	Users can download the annotation file (if not in the provided list) from Gene Ontology Consortium website(http://www.geneontology.org/).

	Alternatively the file can have two columns where the first column contains gene symbols or spot IDs and the second column contains annotations of the genes in the first column. The two columns are delimited by a tab.  Gene symbols and GO annotations can be delimited by either a semicolon (;), comma (','), or a pipe (|).

	Note:
	*If a gene is listed as belonging to a certain GO category that is a sub-category of other categories in the GO hierarchy, it is not necessary to also explicitly list its super-categories.
	*If the same gene appears on multiple lines the union of annotation terms is taken.
	*The file can either be in plain text or a gzipped version of a plain text file in the required format.

	Sample file of two column format:  
	```
	ZFX	GO:0003677;GO:0003713;GO:0008270;GO:0030528;GO:0046872;GO:0006355;GO:0005634
	ZNF133	GO:0003700;GO:0008270;GO:0006355;GO:0005634
	USP2	GO:0004197;GO:0004221;GO:0016787;GO:0006511
	```	
	
	* __Cross Reference Source__  
	Users can choose from "User provided" and "NO cross reference".
	If "User provided" selected, please specify "Cross Reference File" field. 
	Note that leaving the cross-reference field blank under 'User Provided' is equivalent to selecting 'No cross references'.
	
	* __Cross Reference File__  
	 A cross reference file specifies that two or more symbols for the same gene are equivalent. 
	 This file is optional, but is useful in the case where annotation of genes in the annotation 
	 file use a different naming convention than the genes in the data file, 
	 and thus with a cross reference file it is possible to match a gene in the data 
	 file with its annotation in the annotation file even when the symbol used in the data 
	 file does not appear in the annotation file.
	 Note that the cross reference file is only used to map between gene symbol.
	 Any symbols on the same line are considered to be equivalent where symbols are delimited by tabs, 
	 a pipe(|), a comma (',') or a semicolon (;).  The file can either be in plain text or gzipped version of a text file in this format. 
	 
	 Sample cross reference file:
	 
	 ```
	 GeneA	SymbolA
	 GeneB	SymbolB
	 GeneC	SymbolC
	 ```			
* __3. Options__  (Optional, iDREM can run without specifying options)  
The options can be used to provide optional data sets or search setting for model prediction. 
	
	* __ model searching  options __  
	The model searching options include "Gene Annotations", "GO Analysis",  "DECOD Options", "Expression Scaling Options",
	"Filtering Options", "Search Options" and "Model Selection Options". 
	Note users can use the default parameters provided (no need to specify those options). 
	Please refer to the manual for detailed description of those options if users want to change 
	the model searching parameters.  
		
	* __datasets options__  
	There are 3 additional datasets options including "microRNA Option", "Methylation Option" and "Proteomics Option". 
	This optional datasets can provide additional regulatory information, which is helpful for iDREM model prediction. 
		
		* __microRNA Option__
		![microRNA option](images/mirnaoptions.png)
		Users are able to specify the miRNA information (It’s optional. 
		If the miRNA information is available, if will help to predict the regulatory model). There are several
		major ﬁelds for this option dialog.
		
			* __microRNA-gene Interaction Source__  
			This speciﬁes the miRNA-gene interaction. By default, we provided the miRNA-gene interaction predicted by miRanda for Human, Rat, Mouse, Fruitﬂy and Mematode.
		
			* __microRNA-gene Interaction File__  
			Users are also able to use customized miRNA-gene interaction ﬁles. The miRNA-gene interaction must follow the following format requirement. 1st column: miRNA ID 2nd column: gene symbol 3rd column: regulation (It can be binary 1/0 or a ﬂoat binding score in range [0,1]) The columns are tab-delimited.
			example file:  
			```
			MIRNA GENE INPUT
			dme-miR-1 CG18769 1 
			dme-miR-1 CG11710 1 
			dme-miR-1 CG5522 1 
			dme-miR-1 apt 1 
			dme-miR-1 CG3338 1 
			dme-miR-1 LIMK1 1

			```
			* __microRNA Expression Data File__  
			This ﬁeld speciﬁes the microRNA expression data ﬁle. 
			The microRNA expression must follow the following format requirement. 
			1st row: 1st column ”miRNA”, the remaining columns in the ﬁrst row are ID for time points.   
			remaining rows: 1st column represents miRNA ID, the remaining columns represent miRNA expression values.   
			All columns are tab-delimited.  
			example file:  
			![mirnaexpression](images/mirnaexpression.png)
			
			The description of normalization methods and repeats is the same as the gene expression data in the "Data Input". 
		
		* __Methylation Option__   
		![methylation](images/methyoption.png)
		Note that this option can take different types of epigenomic data (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modification)
			
			* __Methylation data File__  
			This methylation data represents the Epigenomic data such as DNA methylation, histone methylation, etc.
			Here the methylation score is used to denote the repression of the region.
			Therefore, different types of Epigenomic data need to be pre-processed differently. 

			For example, if the epigenomic data is DNA methylation, the normalized methylation score [0-1] can be used directly as the input. If the epigenomic data is histone modification, e.g H3K4me2, which is asssociated with activiation,then the input should be (1-normalized histone modification score). 
			In short, the methylation data here should represent 'difficulty' score of TF-binding. The larger score, the smaller probablity of TF binding.  
		   
			The methylation input should be in BED6 format.  
			This file has the following BED6 formatting requirements:   
			1st column: chrom   
			2nd column: ChromStart   
			3rd column: ChromEnd   
			4th column: Name with time point information. It should be in the format of TimePoint_Gene  
			5th column: Methylation score   
			6th column: strand   
			  
			All columns are tab delimited.  
			Sample File:    
			```
			chr7	28372162	28373662	p0.5_Plekhg2	0.21	-
			chr12	76532560	76534060	p0.5_Plekhg3	0.25	+
			chr10	3739377	3740877	p0.5_Plekhg1	0.56	+
			chr6	125380004	125381504	p0.5_Plekhg6	0.41	
			```
			
			* __GTF File__
			
			This is the GTF file associated with given organisms.
			The gene annotation will be obtained from the given GTF file.
			For GTF format, plese refers to : http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html. 
			
		* __Proteomics Option__
		![proteoption](images/proteoption.png)
		Users are able to specify the protein level information using this option, which is helpful for model prediction.
		There are several major fields in this option dialog. 
			* __Proteomics checkbox__  
				* __Only Use Proteomics Data for TFs__ : If checked, only protein level for TFs will be considered.   
				* __Use Proteomics data for all proteins (recommended)__ : If checked, all protein level will be used.
				The "Activity" measurement of TFs is made not not just by the protein level of the TF, but also 
				also the protein level of all potential interacting proteins, which is much more robust to the noise of the protein level.     
				* __Do not Use Proteomics data__: If checked, the proteomics panel will be disabled and no proteomics data will be used.   

			* __Proteomics Data File__  
			This entry specifies a file that contains the time-series proteomics data. 
			A data file includes gene symbols, data values. This file has the following formatting requirements:   
			The first row specifies the time points.   
			For every row after the first, 1st Columns tells the gene name, the following columns tell the corresponding protein level of the gene at each time point.
			
			![proteinlevel](images/proteinlevel.png)
			
			The "Repeat Proteomics Data File" and normalization have the same meaning as the described in "microRNA option" section. 
			
			* __Protein-Protein Interaction File (PPI)__  
			This entry specifies the Protein-protein interaction file.  
			Such data can be downloaded from PPI databases such as STRING or BioGRID. This file has the following formatting requirements:   

			First ,Second Columns present the interacting protein pairs (Using gene names). The first column tells the interaction strength. If such information is not avaiable, use 1 instead.
			All columns are tab-delimited.
			
			Sample file:  
			```
			Gnai3	Adora3	0.813
			Gnai3	Grm6	0.902
			Gnai3	Bdkrb2	0.904
			Gnai3	Akt1	0.717
			Gnai3	Adcy4	0.966
			Gnai3	Rgs19	0.987
			Gnai3	Hck	0.889
			```

# INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION
iDREM provides an interactive visualization of the predicted model besides the iDREM direct output (please refer to manual for details of iDREM direct ouput).
![interactive](images/interactiveViz.png)

Please note that some popup windows might be blocked by the browser. Please pay attention to the top right of the browser.
If blocked, please allow the pop-up window by clicking it and choosing the right option.   


The interactive visualization is composed of the following sections:  

* __Global Config__  
![globalConfig](images/globalConfig.png)  
	* __Zoom sub-panel__  
		* __RESET__  
		Rest all configurations.
		* __Zoom Slider__    
		Use the slider to zoom in/out the model visualization on the right.   
	
	* __Mouse Over sub-panel__  
		* __Enable/Disable mouseover popup checkbox__  
		If checked, show regulating factors when mouse over a node in the model visualization on the right. 
		* __Regulator cutoff slider__   
		This slider is used to control how many regulators will be shown when mouse over a node. By default, it is set as 20, which means that 
		20 regulators at most will be shown in the mouse over popup window. Users are able to choose # of top regulators (10-100) to display on the mouseover popup window.
		
	* __Visualization color sub-panel__  	
		* __Set background__  
		Change/Set the background color in the model visualization on the right.
		* __Set Node color__  
		Change/set the node color in the model visualization on the right.
		* __Set text color__  
		Change/set the text color in the model visualization on the right.
		* __Set path color__   
		Change/set the path color in the model visualization on the right.     
	* __Click sub-panel__
		* __Click__  
		Functions bound to left Click:    
			* __Regulator__  
			show Top TFs for the clicked node (regulating the edge ending at the node). The number of shown TFs is controlled by the regulator cutoff slider in the mouse over sub-panel.
			![topRegulators](images/topRegulators.png)  
			red: down-regulated regulators.  
			blue: up-regulated regulators.  
			gray: non-expressed regulators or filtered regulators (zero or near-zero expression variance across all time points). 
			
			* __Genes Assigned To The Node__  
			show the gene list assigned to the node/path.  (The genes in the path are the same as the genes in the leaf node of the path.)  
			![genesAssignedNode](images/genesAssignedNode.png)
			* __Average Methylation For Genes In Node__   
			show the average methylation score for all genes in the clicked node.  Please note "methylation" score is only representing
			the "repression" score here. It's not necessarily the DNA methylation score. It could be other epigenomic information which iDREM can take as the input. 
			For example, if using H3K4me2 histone modification as the epigenomic input (Methylation option), the methylation score here actually is the opposite of 
			the H3K4me2 histone modification score (1-H3K4me2 score) as H3K4me2 is generally associated with "Activation", which is the opposite of the default "repression"
			associated methylation score used in the visualization.   To understand the meaning of the methylation score correctly, please pay attention to the type of
			the epigenomic data used in the study. 
			
			* __Average Methylation For All Top Regulator Targets__  
			show the average methylation score for the target genes of the top TFs associated to the clicked node.
			The cutoff for top TFs is set by the regulator cutoff slider in the mouse over sub-panel. 
			 
			* __Average Methylation For Top Regulator Targets In Node__
			show the average methylation score for the target genes of the top TFs associated to the clicked node, the target genes must be also in the clicked node. 
			* __Compare Regulator__  
			Compare predicted regulators (TFs and miRNAs) under different models (using Methylation/Proteomics vs Proteomics only vs none) 
			* __Single Cells__  
			show the overlapping comparison between the clicked node and all cell types from the single cell dataset. 
			* __Sorted Cells__  
			show the overlapping comparison between the clicked node and all cell types from the sorted cell dataset. 
		* __Shift Click__  
		Functions bound to shift+Click：   
			* __ToppGene__   
			functional analysis using Toppgene. 
			* __PANTHER__    
			functional analysis using PANTHER.
		

* __Regulator Panel__  
![regulatorConfig](images/regulatorConfig.png)
	* __Explore Regulator__  
	 Type in Regulator Name (TF/miRNA) to search the regulating paths/Edges (Marked in Blue).  
	* __Choose Regulator Dropdown__  
	Choose the regulator from the dropdown menu to search the regulating paths/Edges (Marked in Blue).   
	* __Regulator rank cutoff__  
	The ranking (from 10-100) cutoff used to determine whether the TF/miRNA is regulating the corresponding Edge/node.
	
To undo the search, delete the text and then press enter; or hit the RESET button.    
An example:   
search “STAT1” by type in "STAT1" or select "STAT1" from the dropdown menu (under regulator rank cutoff 50):   
	![regulatorHighlight](images/regulatorHighlight.png)
	
* __Gene Enrichment Panel__  
![geneEnrichmentConfig](images/geneEnrichmentConfig.png)  
For any given gene list, find the enriched nodes (Nodes whose associated genes are significantly overlapping with the given input gene list).
* __Expression Panel__  
![expressionConfig](images/expressionConfig.png)
	* __Show Path Expression__   
	The interactive visualization of the model is organized by the split order to avoid overlapping paths. Therefore, the geometric position of the node is
	not representing the actual expression level. We provided the "Show Path Expression" function to show all the paths based on their expression levels.
	(x-value : time point, y-value: expression level).
	
	Path expression:  
	![pathExpression](images/pathExpression.png)
	* __Explore Gene__   
	Type in Gene Name to show the assigned nodes/paths (Marked in Red). 
	The expression plot (log2 expression relative to time 0) is also provided.   
	![expressionPlot](images/expressionPlot.png)   
	There are 3 different plots for expression (for all expression in the iDREM visualization): LineChart (shown above), ColumnChart and BarChart.   
	ColumnChart:      
	![expressionBarPlot](images/expressionColumnPlot.png)
	 
	BarChart:   
	![expressionBarPlot](images/expressionBarPlot.png)  
	To undo the search: delete the text and then press enter; or hit the RESET button.  
	* __Explore miRNA__   
	Type in miRNA name to show the expression of miRNAs.    
	![mirnaplot](images/mirnaPlot.png)   
	 
	* __Explore Gene/miRNA absolute expression__  
	 The above expression is the relative expression to 0. Those low/zero variance genes were removed from our analysis.
	 To show the expression for those filtered genes, users can  use this "Explore gene/miRNA absolute expression". 
	 Besides, the expression here is the absolute expression (in log2 space) instead of the relative (to time point 0) expression.   
	 ![abExpressionPlot](images/abExpressionPlot.png)
	* __Explore Regulator targets expression__  
	This function is provided to explore the expression of targets of given regulator. Type in the regulator name to search.     
	![regulatorExpressionPlot](images/regulatorExpressionPlot.png)
* __Methylation Panel__  
![MethylationConfig](images/MethylationConfig.png)
	* __Explore gene methylation__  
	Plot the average methylation scores in the promoter region (-1k->+500bp) of of given gene.  Type the gene name or use the dropdown menu to select time points
	and gene names to explore.    
	example plot:    
	![methylationPlot](images/methylationPlot.png)\\
	Please note that the methylation score does not necessarily denotes the DNA methylation score. It depends on the type of the genomic data used as the input for iDREM. 
	But all methylation score here denotes the "repression" associated with the promoter region of the given gene. If the epigenomic data is associated with "activation",
	a pre-processing is needed to transform it to "repression" related (1-normalized activation score). 
	
	* __Explore Regulator Methylation__  
	Plot the methylation scores for all targets of given TF. (Users can even choose the node they are interested in).   
	By choosing a specific node, only the targets in that specific node of the given TF will be considered.   
	
	* __Explore Methylation Difference__ 
	List all genes (miRNAs) with methylation significantly different in specified two time points. 
	
	Top genes with increased methylation in the promoter  
	![upMethylation](images/upMethylation.png)
	
	Top genes with decreased methylation in the promoter  
	![downMethylation](images/downMethylation.png)
	* __View the Methylation Track in UCSC genome browser__  
	As the above analysis is based on the methylation score in promoter region, this might limit the exploration of methylation score in other regions. 
	Therefore, we also provided the visualization of methylation scores (can be any epigeomic scores)  using UCSC genome browser.
	Simply providing the data link for the epigenomic data (in Bam format or bigWig format) and choosing the reference genome accordingly, users are able 
	to explore the epigenomic data in any interested genomic locations using the integrated UCSC genome browser. 
	
* __Proteomics Panel__  
![proteConfig](images/proteConfig.png)
	* __Explore Protein Level__   
	 Type in the protein name (using corresponding gene symbol) to search the corresponding protein level.   
	 ![proteinLevel](images/proteinLevelPlot.png)
	 
* __Cell Types Panel__    
![cellType](images/CellTypeConfig.png)
	* __Explore Single Cell Type__  
	highlight all nodes, which are significantly overlapping with signature genes associated to a specific cell type (based on single cell data)  
	example:  
	![singleCellPlot](images/singleCellPlot.png)  
	* __Explore Sorted Cell Type__    
	Explore Sorted Cell Type: highlight all nodes, which are significantly overlapping with signature genes associated to a specific cell type (based on sorted cell data)

* __Path Function Panel__  
![pathFunctionConfig](images/pathFunctionConfig.png)  
	* __Show path function Sankey Diagram__  
	This plots the Sankey diagram to show the function (GO terms) and regulators (miRNA/TFs) associated to each path.
	
	example:    
	![sankeyDiagram](images/sankeyDiagram.png)  
	Clicking the path on the sankey diagram, users will be able to see the details (Go terms names, p-value, regulating miRNAs, TFs, etc.). 
	
	* __Go Term rank cutoff__:  
	This slider set the GO term rank cutoff for each path. For example, if set as 3, only the top 3 GO terms will be used in the Sankey Diagram.  
	By default, it set as 5.     
	

* __Omnibus Panel__

Key in the Gene(Regulator) name to search all related  expression and methylation.
